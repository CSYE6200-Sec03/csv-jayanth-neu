Design a Person class with the following person attributes:
1. ID
2. age
3. first name
4. last name
5. Parent first name

2. GPA

Derive a Teacher class from the Person class (inherit from Person) with the following Teacher attributes:

1. hourlyWage


100 TOTAL POINTS:

NOTE: 20 points DEDUCTION if LATE or INCORRECT Submission: Submit ON TIME your entire workspace named workspace-eclipseVersion-your-name-csv1, for example: eclipse workspace name:  ‘workspace_2021_9_dan_peters_csv1’


Requirements:
1. 10 points: Eclipse Java SE project named Project1 with main method in Driver class only, Object Oriented Design is required so main method will use Classes or Objects to control the overall program execution. Your class will have a static demo() method which is called by main()

2. 10 points Code, Compile with no errors using Object Oriented Design a Person class, i.e. design a useful Person class with useful methods and programmed in ‘Person.java’.

3. 20 points Code, Compile with no errors using Object Oriented Design a Student and Teacher classses, i.e. design a useful classes with useful Student and Teacher methods and inherited Person methods and programmed  in ‘Student.java’ and ‘Teacher.java’.

4. 20 points Code, Compile with no errors using Object Oriented Design a method (or methods) in the Student class for parsing a Student CSV string and creating a Student object, i.e. design a useful Student class with useful Student methods for parsing and programmed  in ‘Student.java’.

4. 20 points Code, Compile with no errors using a File Utility class, i.e. design a useful FileUtility class with useful methods for reading and writing files and programmed in ‘FileUtil.java’.

5. 10 points Execution: Run your compiled program with Console Output: Show the state (i.e. all data) for 4 Students and a 1 Teacher object, e.g. show: Student name, age, GPA and Teacher name, age and wage. Cut and paste your console output (text) at the end of your main function as a comment

6. 10 points Sort a List of Students 5 times: by ID, StudentID, Last Name, First Name, GPA
